        <h3>The nature of the world varies from people to people. 
            <br>Just as the quote <em>"Beauty lies in the eyes of the
            beholder." </em> <br>the world is dynamic as every individual see it through their eyes.
        </h3>

        <h4>The Harsh Reality</h4>
        <p><em>I see the world as dark and filled with chaos. It is cruel and filthy. It is filled with suffering and hardships.
            I see the dark side of the world not just in war, greed or lies but emptiness behind people's eyes. 
        People compete with each other from the moment they were born. They run and run and run not knowing the destination, 
        and meeting a common end - death.</em></p>

    <div class="second">
        <h4>The Magic I believe In</h4>
        <p><em>I have always believed in magic since childhood. The kind that's only real in myths and fantasy. 
            There's a line in Cinderella, "Where there is kindness, there is magic." I believe there still do exist witches,
        vampires, mermaids, warewolves and other mythical creatures. I do believe Harry Potter and his world did exist and wish
        to live them by myself. In my point of view the world is full of mystry and beautiful things. If we were to truly explore 
        the nature then, who knows what we might encounter - maybe one of those mythical creatures?</em></p>

        <h4>Romanticizing Death</h4>
        <p><em>All people in this world like to descend to heaven but none likes to die. I've never feared death. It always looked very
            peaceful and calm to me. It's an escape I've been longing for. Romanticizing death isn't about giving up on life rather 
            it's about understanding life's fragility. It's about how quickly moments slip through our fingertips and how little we truly control.
            There is a different kind of beauty in something so final, inevitable, yet so misunderstood.
